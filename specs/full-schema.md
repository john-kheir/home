# G8OS (G8 Operating System)

# core0
core0 is a replacement for sysvinit/systemd, it provides process management and administration.
This core0 is specialy made for running containers and be easy to administrate.

The default way to manage filesystem is the integrated [flist support](https://github.com/g8os/fs).
Our filesystem engine is build-in on the core0.
You can host a complete operating system with this way (it's used by the containers). You only need the metadata and
not download the full image, files are downloaded on-demand, which speed up dramaticaly the startup process.

The client (and core0) integrate some default management like:
 - Network management (bridge, etc.)
 - Disks management (partitions, ...)
 - [ZeroTier](https://github.com/zerotier/ZeroTierOne) default network integration
 - [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) support integration

# initramfs
To start the core0, we currently bundle it in an initramfs.
The full details about initramfs can be found on [the dedicated repository](https://github.com/g8os/initramfs)

## Why bundle it ?
We build an initramfs which is bundled with the kernel.
This allow us to sign the kernel one time and make sur that it cannot be altered or replaced on our SecureBoot environment.

## Content
Initramfs contains:
- `busybox` (mostly full)
- `core0`
- `ipfs` (integrated with core0)
- `fuse` userland tools
- `ca-certificates` for some ssl support
- `redis-server` used as communication backend
- `iproute2` utilities
- `nftables` as firewall
- `dnsmasq` for default network management
- `zerotier one`
- `btrfs` utilities
- `parted` for partition management


## Bootstrap
When the kernel start in the initramfs, the `/init` script is executed.
This script populate `/dev`, `/proc` and `/sys` and prepare a ramdisk where to boot after.

This is probably not _absolutly_ needed but leaving the initramfs is always a good idea.
In this case, we switch to another ramfs but this can be changed easily.

# Booting the kernel
When you boot the kernel, theses step are achieved:
- **Preparing the root ramfs**: initializing a default ramfs whith all the needed files
- **Launching the core0**:
  - **Starting services**:
    - Logs
    - IPFS Daemon
    - Network
    - Redis
- **Waiting input from redis**: use the client to communicate

# Create a container
You can easily create a container when the core0 is up, from the [python client](https://github.com/g8os/core0/tree/master/pyclient)
`cl.container.create('Address of the root filesystem metadata')`
